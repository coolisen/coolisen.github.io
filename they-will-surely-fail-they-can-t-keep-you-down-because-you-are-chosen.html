      <td>They Can’t Keep You Down Because You Are Chosen!<br /><br />Today I’d like start by encouraging you to subscribe to our youtube channel, click on the notification bell, to be notified when we upload a new video every time. God bless you. <br /><br />Many people always believe that every time they go through difficult situations that seems to become the end of their lives without realizing that it’s only beginning. When going through this journey of life you might feel at times as though you are buried by challenges, negative comments from people, you may be feeling like you are not good enough. The Bible says that God has  “…. given us great and precious promises. These are the promises that enable you to share his divine nature and escape the world’s corruption caused by human desires.” 2 Peter 1:4. Thus, as a child of God, you have His nature, in you, there is a seed of favor, creativity, courage, and nothing can stand against you. You can’t have the nature of God’s and  be average. That seed will override challenges and propel you where you can’t go on your own. You may have made mistakes, but there’s something in you that can’t stop the seed. You may have come from negative circumstances, but that doesn’t change your seed. Don’t let how you were raised, what you didn’t get, or any dysfunction convince you that you’re not up to par, that you can’t do something great. Because you’re great seed, you are going to grow and blossom. Don’t allow you season of being buried to cloud your harvest time. <br /><br /><br />It is impossible to skip levels in life because God’s very character involves being a God of order and harmony. Existing eternally as the Trinity, the Lord God is complete, unified, and peaceful. He always acts in a harmonious and orderly manner. He is not chaotic or unstable. You cannot ask God to skip out on the development of your life simply because you are uncomfortable with being alone in the dark during your planting season. In life, you have to realize that the dirt is good for you. At times, it feels like you’re literally a buried. You’ll feel like you’ll never get passed a sickness, a trouble, an addiction or situation in your life. It’s dark, you feel pressure all around, and you don’t see a way out. The good news is that you’re not buried, you’re planted. The difference is that when you’re buried, you’re done, but when you’re planted, you’re coming up again, stronger, healthier, more successful. Even though being planted feels the same as being buried. It’s  dark, it’s uncomfortable, you feel pushed down and compacted. If you judge things too soon and get discouraged, you’ll give up on your dreams. Don’t forget to subscribe to our youtube channel, like and share this video with friends and family.<br /> <br />A seeds is meant to be covered to die, to keep a seed from being planted is to condemn that seed to never realize its full potential. When you allow God to shift your mindset, you will begin to see that everything happened for a reason. If you look back at the sprout that pushed itself through the ceiling of dirt above it, you will discover the reasons behind your adversity that were previously invisible and imaginable but now are suddenly apparent and miraculous when you arrive at the fruit-bearing stage. “I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat is planted in the soil and dies, it remains alone. But its death will produce many new kernels—a plentiful harvest of new lives.”<br />John 12:24. God is taking you and where He will continue to take you. You will notice the planting process into the best but it will help grow your faith, deepens your relationship with God especially in the area of trust. Because God will never intend to lead you to a dead place and leave you there, the planting is merely a new beginning of what the planting and death of each seed is all about, Godis not burying you His planting you. Do not run from it; embrace it. The proverbial death of what you are trying to keep alive will enrich the growth and lives of others. God is planting you in richer soil for greater fruit.<br /><br /> ““But blessed are those who trust in the Lord and have made the Lord their hope and confidence. They are like trees planted along a riverbank, with roots that reach deep into the water. Such trees are not bothered by the heat or worried by long months of drought. Their leaves stay green, and they never stop producing fruit.” Jeremiah 17:7-8, this passage here is referring to a believer as a tree planted by the living waters; when you put your trust in the Lord and not in the soil you will be like a tree planted not buried. During such moments, you must trust that something is growing. Something is being birthed in the invisible realities you cannot see.</td>
