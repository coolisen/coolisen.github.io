Greene was screaming that the Democrats were "murderers", and Democratic Representative Debbie Dingell fired back at Greene until she finally slipped away. Shortly after these incident went public on social media, Greene’s chief of staff abruptly resigned. Is Greene losing even her most ardent supporters and staffers as her behavior becomes more and more outrageous? Ring of Fire’s Farron Cousins discusses this. <br /><br />Link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rawstory.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-2655171356/">https://www.rawstory.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-2655171356/</a><br /><br />Become a member today!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join</a><br /><br />Support us by becoming a monthly patron on Patreon, and help keep progressive media alive!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire">https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire</a><br /><br />Find our merchandise at Teespring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store">https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store</a><br /><br />Spread the word!

They were cameras there, reporters there, holding out their microphones. Democrats were just talking about some things. Debbie Dingell, Democratic representative from Michigan was there, Marjorie Taylor Greene walks up, not all the way of course, because she didn’t want any kind of real confrontation. But she’s a few steps down and she starts yelling that these Democrats are murderers. You’re murderers, she’s yelling, sounding like a complete nut job that you would avoid if they were standing on a street corner screaming the same thing. Which is basically what she is just happens to be an elected official in Congress, yelling at them that they were murderers.<br /><br />Well, Debbie Dingell got and Dingell came out screaming back at Marjorie Taylor Greene, giving her a dose of her own medicine to the point where Greene had to slink away. Not long after that, her chief of staff said, I’m out. And Marjorie Taylor Greene released a statement that said, I want to thank my chief of staff, Patrick Parsons for helping me to take the fight to the socialist Democrats as I’ve transitioned into Congress. He’s advised me he will be moving back into the political arena to help elect America first conservatives who can fight alongside me. Nah, I don’t think that’s it at all. I don’t think Patrick Parsons was suddenly like, oh shoot, hey, um, look Marjorie. I’m going to go and find other people to help get elected so they can serve with you, um, which will be totally great. Like it’s really going to help you here.<br /><br />So I’m gonna go, I’m gonna find these people. But you, you stay here. You keep doing. No, he was embarrassed, I think. Obviously I cannot speak for what this individual actually felt. I have not seen him, Patrick Parsons, release any kind of statement saying he left because of XYZ. But the timing of it, right? That’s a little suspicious. Not to mention the fact that her entire career in Congress, which I know it doesn’t feel like it, but it hasn’t even been a full year yet, folks. She is only been in Congress for nine months. And I feel like we have been talking about her for an eternity because every day there is something new with her. Every day, every other day, at least several times a week, she says something incredibly stupid, offensive or crazy. And I think this guy Patrick Parsons had just finally had enough.<br /><br />He’s like, look, you’re not even serving on any committees. You were stripped of all that, you know, shortly after you came to DC. All these past videos have emerged of you acting like a frigging lunatic in the halls of Congress before you were even elected. You keep these crazy and outrageous things. I can’t keep up with this. I am done. Good for you, Patrick. Good for you. But if Marjorie Taylor Greene is telling the truth, which I have no reason to believe she is, and your real goal is in fact to go out there and find other people like her and get them elected to Congress. Then I have to say, you’re a horrible human being and I hope that you fail. But I don’t think that’s why you left.</p>
